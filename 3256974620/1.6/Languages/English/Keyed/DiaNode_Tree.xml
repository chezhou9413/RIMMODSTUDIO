When this function is enabled, colonists capable of hauling will try to find suitable apparel for the milian in the storage area and equip it. The auto-equip system selects the optimal clothing based on armor value, quality, and maximum hit point, using a point-based system to choose the best option. Enabling this function will cause a certain level of computational load, so if you experience lag during gameplay, you can choose to enable or disable this feature as needed.</Milira.MilianConfigGuidePage1><Milira.MilianConfigGuidePage2>-About Equipment Switch-\nIn addition to assigning a colonist to change Milian's weapon, you can also click on a Milian's weapon slot in the Milian configuration interface.

If you no longer wish to change the weapon after confirming, click the weapon slot again to find the option to cancel the switch, or interrupt the Milian's current job to cancel it.</Milira.MilianConfigGuidePage2><Milira.MilianConfigGuidePage3>-About Work Management-\nAfter unlocking the technology "Milian Work Permissions", a new button will appear on this tab.
