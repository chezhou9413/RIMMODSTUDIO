Although their physical strength is Weak, they have an extremely low rate of energy loss when used as a medium for various forms of energy, which is why they are widely used by the Lord in the manufacture of various electronic components. \n In addition to being used as a manufacturing material, solar crystals also have high ornamental and collectible value. \n The Lord's celestial metropolis is rich in this type of crystal.
